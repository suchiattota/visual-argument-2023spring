# The Cover-Up: Visual Argument Spring 2023
This is Suchi's rhetorical collage assignment for Benjamin Miller's course in [Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/)

It is based on my [audio narrative project](https://github.com/suchiattota/audio-narrative-2023spring) for the same class.
My visual argument is a visual represntation of my audio narrtive. It could be thought of as a poster for my story. It has has the same title as the narrative, "The Cover-Up". I wanted to subtly include elements from the narrative in the poster. This can be seen in the the title. The letter O has a wolf in it because during the narrative you hear an animal howl and the letter U has a shovel inside, which is the tool used by one my characters to dig a hole. We see a car in the woods because my characters drove the car to the woods to bury a body and we also see my chacatrers on the left side with one of them holding to shovel.
