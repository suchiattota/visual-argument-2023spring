Pushed the first preview of my visual argument project. I didn’t realize how long it takes to find images and fonts I like. I first started by searching for a suitable font. I wanted thick letters as I was planned on modifying them. I also wanted slightly rounded edges, my reasoning behind this was that straight edges seemed a little too formal and I wanted something easy-going and not serious. I didn’t want fully rounded edges because that would look like bubble font and that wouldn’t do well with my argument. It took some time to find this font, but I eventually found a suitable font and was happy with my selection. I placed the text with the font on a background to eck if I like the font and once I was happy with it I went on to search for three other images, namely a coyote, shovel, and a forest/woods background. The woods background took a while to find and involved downloading multiple images and opening them in Gimp only to realize they weren’t the type of picture I was looking for. Finally found the main background image I will be using on Upsplash. I found the type of pictures I wanted for the coyote and shovel on The Noun Project. Although I didn’t end up using the images I first selected as only while editing I realized those images were not the right ones to accomplish the task I was trying to do. But with the suitable images I accomplished editing as shown in **Screenshot 1** in progress-screenshots.md. I first used the bucket fill tool to fill in a black background color around the text and using the same tool I filled in the inner circle of the letter O with white to have a round white circle. On this I placed the image of the black wolf. Doing this took up a lot of time because the crop and scale tools weren’t working right, and I had to remove and add layers of the same image multiple times. Restarting Gimp fixed this issue. Then I used the zoom, rotate, and move tool to place the wolf on the text at the exact place I wanted. I followed the same process to add a shovel inside the letter U. Once I was happy with the placement of the images I merged the three layers i.e., text, wolf, and shovel, so they can act as one image. Then I used the fuzzy select tool to select the black background around the text, the black wolf and shovel and cleared the color. This gave a text on a transparent background with a wolf and shovel outline cut into the letters O and U. I then placed this on my woods background which can be seen in **Screenshot 2**. I am extremely happy with the progress I made although I wasn’t initially enjoying using Gimp to edit. I am still learning to edit on and get used to Gimp. It involves a lot of googling to find out how to do certain tasks, but I am excited to see the final file of my project.
